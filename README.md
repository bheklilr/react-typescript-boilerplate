# react-typescript-boilerplate

My version of a boilerplate project for creating React apps with Typescript.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! I HAVE ONLY BEEN WRITING REACT AND TYPESCRIPT FOR A FEW MONTHS!!!**

## Use

To use this project, run

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/bheklilr/react-typescript-boilerplate.git my-project
> cd my-project
> npm run setup
> npm install
```

This will check out this boilerplate into a folder named `my-project`, then
clean up the git repo so you can start fresh.  Next, the dependencies are 
installed, and you are ready to start developing.

# Tech Stack

This boilerplate code is opinionated, for better or worse.  The major tools 
included in this project are:

- react
- typescript
- redux
- redux-saga
- reselect
- react-router
- immutable
- styled-components
- intl
- lodash
- jest
- enzyme
- plop

This project is heavily inspired by [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate).

# Documentation

Hah!

(I'll get to this at some point)

# License

I like MIT, but I personally don't care what you do with this code.  Use at
your own risk.  If you submit a pull request I'll be happy because I don't
know what I'm doing most of the time.
